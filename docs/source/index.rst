Welcome to Interim PRE Application documentation!
=================================================

.. note::

   This project is under active development.


Overview
--------

The threshold proxy re-encryption (PRE) application is one of many applications
provided by the Threshold Network. PRE is a more scalable form of public-key
encryption (PKE) that allows a proxy entity to transform encrypted data from one
public key to another, without ever decrypting the data or having access to any
private keys. It provides secrets management and dynamic access control capabilities
to users. This service is provided by decentralized nodes on the Threshold Network
running the PRE node client.

Nodes are expected to remain online to provide uninterrupted on-demand PRE
services to the network of users.


.. note::

    In the traditional NuCypher Network parlance, ``Worker`` can be used interchangeably
    with the new Threshold Network ``Operator`` term.
